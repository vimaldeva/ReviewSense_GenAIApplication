"This course definetily was the launchpad I needed to get into the development space. I learnt a lot which I'd like to believe not only  gave me the skills to create but also work my thinking muscles and prowess as a developer. Some part were difficult to maneuver, to be specific the last modules which were based on Blockchain and DApps, configuration of the projects locally was difficult and I had to do a lot of heavy lifting but that's about it when it comes to the downside.

"I love the course and how everything is explained by Angela but I've come to realize that the only thing that is updated is the year in the course title. A lot of what is taught isn't up to date, this course doesn't cover quite a few things.

"I have went through this course thoroughly with having a full time job. I will say do not judge by public opinion that this course is outdated or anything, the theme always remain the same, if you are a beginner just try getting the core concept what she is sharing,and try to go with each content without comparing it with others, great things takes time and you cannot become a developer in a Month also no course is perfect, its your effort which will make you a developer.","if you are a beginner just try getting the core concept what she is sharing,and try to go with each content without comparing it with others, great things takes time and you cannot become a developer in a Month also no course is perfect .",NEGATIVE
"The course is good for people like me who don't have any previous experience with developing. It tackles a lot of basic concepts and serves as a principle for further development (even the more deprecated modules have something to teach you, if you are starting from zero). The entire Web3 section is unnecessary in my opinion, as it covers a whole different area not related to front-end or back-end, and could very well by a course on its own to those who are interested in this topic.",the course is good for people like me who don't have previous experience with developing . it tackles a lot of basic concepts and serves as a principle .,NEGATIVE
"Angela sounds like she is giving you great instruction but it was a big let down seeing a lot of this course not updated. The most very basic thing, which is var, should be changed to let or const variables. Also, she is quite spotty in her teaching. She glosses over things and misses the main point often especially in the last half of this course. It's almost as if she doesn't have a good grasp of the knowledge and how all these puzzle pieces fit. I was not motivated at all by the time I reached the half of the course because I couldn't understand her use of certain terms. My partner who is an automation engineer, who automates programming itself, has even told me the same. For example, when she is describing ECMA script versus the older technology when writing code require vs import for native modules from node. I gave two stars because although she does explain certain things wonderfully, she is a big let down when she is not updating, or explaining things that are really important at the moment and just glossing over them. This made me leave the course and have to start all over again. She tries to motivate you with these pep talk videos like how you should structure your learning, and how you should take notes, and how you should take breaks and not get overwhelmed like little youtube personal blogs with her on camera. However, in hindsight, this just feels like filler and she wastes crucial time to help you understand some concepts. Good luck and happy coding.",var should be changed to let or const variables . it's almost as if she doesn't have a good grasp of the knowledge and how all these puzzle pieces fit.,NEGATIVE

"Great course for anyone looking to delve into web development and web 3.0. Angela not only guides you meticulously through the material but also shares valuable do's and don'ts of web development. The course is structured exceptionally well for beginners, and those already at a beginner level can use it to progress to an intermediate level in various technologies. The learning curve of the course is linear, but it becomes steeper after reaching 70%, particularly at the API section. The course is regularly updated, and while the content on authentication is excellent, breaking down the 30-minute videos into 2-3 shorter ones would enhance the learning experience. Web 3.0 isn't that much necessary it can become a separate course, more material on JavaScript, node, express and react will be more valuable to students.","the course is structured exceptionally well for beginners . it becomes steeper after reaching 70%, especially at the API section . the content on authentication is excellent, but breaking down the 30-minute videos into 2-3 shorter ones would enhance the learning experience .",POSITIVE

This course is incomplete and it cannot be followed from beginning to end.

"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp.

"The entire Authentication and Security section uses MongoDB when we were taught PostgreSQL. This makes it very hard to fall along. The Web3 chapters seem out of place here. No take of error handling. It would've been nice to bring everything together and build an app using our entire stack of technologies (a PERN stack), I don't quite know how to use them together using proper convention and error handling on a server.

"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3.

"The course is exceptional at teaching the core concepts and providing examples, it still needs to be complemented with database managing (normalization), DevOps pipelines, and Agile development practices to become an integral web developer. The only really deprecative aspect is that some modules are outdated, the course instructs to use the versions listed, but sometimes they're not available anymore, and it's more important to learn the current version, since that's what would be expected when working. This is especially noticeable in the MongoDB and mongoose modules, where almost the whole module doesn't remotely resemble the current state of MongoDB and Mongoose.","the course is exceptional at teaching the core concepts and providing examples . it needs to be complemented with database management, devOps pipelines, and Agile development practices . some modules are outdated, but sometimes they're not available anymore .",NEGATIVE

"11/2023: The first half of the course was okay and fun. I enjoyed HTML, CSS and JS beginnings. But once u get to the backend stuff and more advanced JS, the learning curve seemed too steep, if you a complete beginner. I switched to a different course and I am very happy about it. Repeating some stuff and learning new details that were not mentioned in this course. Understanding basics and having solid knowledge foundations, is super important otherwise all will become a word soup in the end. So, look around and see which course suits you the best. Also, this course should NOT have been named 2023 Web Bootcamp because some stuff is not updated.
